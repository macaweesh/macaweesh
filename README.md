## About Me

I work in the technology field with experience in system design, software development, business analysis, and digital transformation. My main focus is turning complex business processes into stable, scalable, and maintainable digital platforms.

I have delivered more than ten internal systems for HR, Finance, Sales, Credit Analysis, Legal, Operations, Construction, and Executive Office. Most of these systems were built end-to-end — from pain point discovery and requirements analysis to architecture, development, deployment, training, and ongoing improvement.

I enjoy simplifying complexity, designing clear workflows, and helping teams adopt tools that align with real business needs. I adapt quickly to new domains, work closely with stakeholders at all levels, and focus on creating long-term solutions rather than temporary fixes.
