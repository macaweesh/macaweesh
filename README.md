## 💡 About Me

I work in the technology field with experience across system design, software development, business analysis, and digital transformation. My main strength is turning complex business processes into clean, scalable digital platforms.

I’ve designed and delivered more than ten internal systems across HR, Finance, Sales, Credit Analysis, Legal, Operations, Construction, and Executive Office. Most of them were built end-to-end — from pain point discovery to deployment and long-term support.

I enjoy simplifying complexity, designing practical workflows, and helping teams adopt tools that actually make sense for their work. I adapt quickly to any domain, work well with stakeholders at all levels, and always aim for clarity and practicality.
